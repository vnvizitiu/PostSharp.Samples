# PostSharp.Samples.AutoRetry

The `AutoRetry` aspect, when applied to a method, retries the execution of the method when the previous execution results in an exception.

You can use the `AutoRetry` aspect to improve the stability of your application by making it more resilient to anticipated, temporary failures. 
The `AutoRetry` aspect is most often applied to code that attempts to connect to a remote service or a network resource. 
The maximum number of retries and the delay between retries can be configured using the attribute properties `MaxRetries` and `Delay`.

The `AutoRetry` aspect implementation demonstrates how to use the `MethodInterceptionAspect` and also shows how to use custom attribute properties to customize the aspect.
